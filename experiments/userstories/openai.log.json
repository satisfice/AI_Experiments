Joe receives the hello message the next day, visits the group, and leaves an introductory message for his neighbours.\n7.  On that group Jane discovers that there is a collective barbecue the next weekend and leaves time in the calendar for the family to go there with the family.\n8.

Jillian downloads iFoaf to her smart phone, starts the program, enters her identity, and authenticates herself to her home server. The client gets her profile data and initiates the application with data taken from her Social Web Server and her client\n2.  The Application asks Jillian if she wishes to add people found in the smart phone address book to one of her already published groups or a new one. Denise publishes them to a new group, to categorise later\n3.  As Jillian is an EFF advocate she travels a lot, and so do many of the people she is in contact with. So she often does not know what time it is for the person she wants to call. But she has convinced 50% of her friends to have their own home servers with Social Web compliant APIs.\n4.  Jillian uses iFoaf to call people. If the person she wishes to call publishes her time zone info, Jillian can know if it is advisable to call them. Jillian always gets the latest phone number people are using, and never has out of date phone numbers.\n5.  As Jillian travels iFoaf can let her know what friends of hers happen to be in the same town. She can quickly message them to say hello.\n6.  Any messages Jillian sends travels over an encrypted channel directly to her friends computer, so Jillian knows that her messages are never read by anyone else than their intended recipients.\n7.  Jillian's server also allows traffic over Tor, to allow her to communicate with people in politically sensitive positions.\n"
