It would be helpful to know if this reminder will be automatically sent out by the system or if it will require manual intervention.\n\n2. Reminder Frequency: The specification does not specify the frequency at which the reminder messages will be sent out. It would be beneficial to determine if the reminder will be sent only once, or if it will be sent periodically until the account is reactivated or deleted.\n\n3. Reminder Delivery Method: The specification does not mention the method by which the reminder messages will be delivered to the account holders. It would be useful to know if the reminders will be sent via email, SMS, or any other communication channel.\n\n4.

It would be important to define the steps or procedures that account holders need to follow in order to reactivate their accounts.\n\n5.

It would be beneficial to provide more specific details about the content and format of the reminder message, such as the language to be used, any additional instructions or links, and any legal or regulatory requirements that need to be included.\n\n4.

It would be important to define how account holders can take action to reactivate their accounts, including any necessary forms, fees, or requirements.\n\n5.

This implies that the system should have a mechanism to track the account opening date and calculate the expiry date accurately.\n\n2. Grace Period:\n   - The spec mentions a grace period of six months before the expired account is closed and the account information is deleted. This implies that the system should have a mechanism to track the expiry date and calculate the end of the grace period accurately.\n\n3. Reminder Notification:\n   - The requirement states that three months before the account information is deleted, a reminder message should be sent to the account holders. This implies that the system should have a mechanism to schedule and send out reminder notifications based on the calculated expiry date and the end of the grace period.\n\n4. Reminder Content:\n   - The spec mentions that the reminder message should contain the expiry date and the date on which the grace period ends. This implies that the system should be able to generate reminder messages with accurate expiry and grace period end dates.\n\n5.
