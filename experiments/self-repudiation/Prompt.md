**Requirement (written by the project manager)**

We are implementing an account renewal reminder feature in an existing account management system.

**Background**

- An account expires three years to the day after it is opened.

- There is a grace period of six months before the expired account is closed and the account information deleted.

- Three months before the account information is deleted, we want account holders to be reminded that their expired account will be closed and deleted at the end of the grace period, and offer them the opportunity to reactivate the account before that happens.

- The reminder message will be sent out on the reminder date, and will contain the expiry date and the date on which the grace period ends.

- The calculation of the expiry date and the end of the grace period has already been thoroughly tested.
