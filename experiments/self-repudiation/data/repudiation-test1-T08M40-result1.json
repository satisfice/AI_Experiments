They encompass multiple aspects such as functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and system behaviors in different scenarios. Here are some reasons why these points are critical:\n\n1. Method of Communication: This affects how the reminder is coded, sent, and how its receipt is confirmed.\n\n2. Reminder Content: Having the exact content helps testers verify that the correct information is being sent.\n\n3. Time Zone Considerations: These can cause issues with when reminders are sent. Testers need to verify that reminders are correctly timed regardless of the user's location.\n\n4. Renewal process: This is part of the user journey. Testers need to ensure the user can successfully renew after receiving a reminder.\n\n5. Multiple Reminders: If these are sent, testers need to ensure that the timing, content, and delivery of additional reminders is correct.\n\n6. Test Cases: These provide specific scenarios to test, ensuring the feature is thoroughly vetted for issues.\n\n7. Error Handling: Ensuring the system can handle errors prevents system crashes and data loss.\n\n8. Data Privacy Compliance: This is vital to protect user information and avoid legal issues.\n\n9. Language and Localization Consideration: These ensure that reminders are understandable and correct for users in all regions.\n\nHowever, these points are general best practices. If the feature is for a very specific context or user base, some of these points might not apply or there might be other, more specific points to consider."
